# Hi there! 👋

I'm Thibaut, a young man passionate about the realms of data, AI, and emerging technologies. Here, you'll find some projects I've worked on during and after my studies. I plan to add more to help make AI and computer vision accessible to everyone, even your uncle who just discovered Excel. 🚀

## About Me

- 🌐 Exploring the world of data, AI, and emerging technologies.
- 📚 Continuous learner and coding enthusiast.
- 🚀 Here to collaborate, learn, and share.

## My Projects

### Ongoing Projec: CVeasy
- A webapp combining the power of computer vision and Ai to help everyone edit photos and videos.
- This will end your suffering from blurring a face frame by frame.
- What about adding some depth to your images thanks to inpainting and parallax ?

### Future ideas:
- Generative AI is making waves these days. I've been a gamer since my young age and have always been interested in this industry. We might create asset packages with stable diffusion algorithm fed with real world datas.
